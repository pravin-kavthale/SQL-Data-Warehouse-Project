# üì¶ Welcome to the Sales Data Warehouse Project!

Welcome to my beginner-friendly Data Warehouse project! This project is designed to help understand the fundamentals of data warehousing through a real-world **sales analytics use case**.

---

## üìò About the Project

This project builds a **Sales Data Warehouse** for an online retail store using a **Star Schema** design. It demonstrates the **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** process, dimensional modeling, SQL-based data analysis, and reporting through tools like **Power BI** or **Excel**.

The core goal is to simulate how data engineers and analysts work with structured data in enterprise environments for **Business Intelligence**.

## üß† Key Architecture

### 1. Modern Data Warehouse Architecture
![Modern Data Warehouse Architecture](./docs/data_architecture.png)
- Raw data from CRM and ERP systems is ingested into the **Bronze Layer**
- Transformed and cleansed in the **Silver Layer**
- Aggregated and business-ready in the **Gold Layer**
- Final outputs are used for **BI tools**, **SQL queries**, and **ML models**

---

### 2. Table Lineage Across Layers
![Bronze to Gold Layer Mapping](./docs/data_flow.png)
- Visual representation of how tables move from **Bronze ‚ûù Silver ‚ûù Gold**
- Tracks each table‚Äôs transformation lifecycle

---

### 3. Star Schema Design (Fact & Dimension)
![Star Schema ER Diagram](./images/star_schema.png)
- This is the final data model in the **Gold Layer**
- Consists of:
  - `dim_customers`
  - `dim_products`
  - `fact_sales`
- Enables fast and flexible analytics with calculated metrics like:
  - **Sales Amount = Quantity √ó Price**
